# Terraform Manager Script

This repository contains a Python script that automates the management of Terraform configuration files for AWS Lambda functions. It allows you to modify and push Terraform files to a Git repository. The script dynamically replaces placeholders in Terraform configuration files with real values such as Lambda names, handlers, priorities, and more.

## Features

- Dynamically update Terraform configuration files with parameters like Lambda name, handler, priority, etc.
- Optionally push the modified file to a remote Git repository (like GitHub).
- Supports modification of Terraform files for AWS Lambda functions, including paths, priorities, environment variables, and more.

1. **Python 3.x**: Python is required to run the script. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Git**: Git is needed for version control. Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **Terraform**: Terraform is required to interact with AWS services. Download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
